1. Class Design

Book Class

Library Class

· Attributes: Collections of books and users (using STL containers)
· Methods: CRUD operations for books/users, search functions, statistics
· Singleton Pattern: Ensures single library instance

· Search Capabilities: Search by title, author, genre, or ISBN
· Borrowing System: Limit checks, due date tracking, fine calculation
